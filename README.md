# OVERVIEW

As part of my internship project, I developed a fully interative dashboard using Tableau Public to visualize trends ands rankings from Netflix viewership data. The goal was to gain actionable insights into global content consumption patterns by analyzing various aspects like popular shows, country-wise preferences, long-running titles, and content trends over time.

# TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED

1. Tableau Public-
Used to create interactive visualizations design a structured layout that presents insights clearly and attractively

2. CSV Dataset-
The project used a Netflix ranking dataset with around 240,000 recordsm, containing weekly show rankings across countries and time.

3. Microsoft Excel-
Used for basic data cleaning, filtering and checking for inconsistencies before importinh the data into Tableau.

4. Python-
Can be used for preprocessing large datasets- such as aggregating, sorting or filtering- before loading them into Tableau for visualization.

# REAL- WORLD APPLICATIONS

1. Content strategy:
Streaming platforms can tailor regional content offering based on popularity by country

2. Marketing insights:
Identify which shows trend globally vs. regionally for targeted advertising.

3. Viewer Retention Analysis:
Determine which shows maintain persistent viewership over time.

4.Data- driven production:
Helps media companies decide on renewals, spin-offs, or sequels based on show performance.

# KEY INSIGHTS FROM THE DASHBOARD

1. Top Show:
Stranger Things emerged as the most ranked show globally, maintaining high popularity over time.

2. Most persistent Titles:
Shows like Maid, Wednesday, and Animal Kingdom stayed in the Top 10 for longer periods, proving their consistent engagement.

3. Geo trends:
The “Top Titles by Country” visualization gave spatial insight into how content is consumed across global latitudes and longitudes.

4. Content trends over years:
TV content continued to dominate viewership trends across 2021–2023.

# OUTCOMES

1. Successfully created an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard summarizing complex data into digestible insights.

2. Enhanced hands-on experience in data visualization, storytelling with data, and using Tableau for real-time analytics.

3. Gained deeper understanding of user engagement and content analytics in the entertainment industry.

# CONCLUSION

This project helped me bridge the gap between raw data and meaningful insights. By leveraging data visualization, I was able to uncover patterns in global content preferences and trends that could influence strategic decisions in the media and entertainment industry. This task not only enhanced my technical skillset but also deepened my understanding of data-driven storytelling.
